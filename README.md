# American-Sign-Language

This project aims at making the machine understand American Sign Langauages. We have worked with 10 words. Which are 'ABOUT' 						
'AND', 'CAN', 'COP', 'DEAF','DECIDE', 'FATHER', 'FIND', 'GO OUT', 'HEARING'. We have used Decision Trees, Support Vector Machine and 
Neural Networks to learn the gestures.
